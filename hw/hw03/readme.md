#About Chris Kistner
Let's see where to begin, I graduated from Seattle University in 2005 with a
degree inn business. I had always been interested in coputers but I was never
able to get intothe shear volume of math needed to complete a CS degree. Not
that I can't do math but being young and naive I just the path of least
resistance. Since then I've worked in a variety of jobs and field, my
current position is one I created for myself as an independent marketing/
business consultant specializing in geriatric companies. So skilled-nursing
clinics, assisted-living homes, CCRCs that kind of thing. Here's my current
primary client (https://roolan.com "Roo Lan Health Care"). As you can see their
website needs plenty of work.

##Why I'm at Codefellows
I came to Codefellows for two main reasons. First, I want to do something more
challenging with my life. I feel like I've hit a wall in my career as far as
business goes and I want to get into the tech industry where there are more
opportunities for a career growth. Second I have the time, as a consultant I
work when I want however much I want and the money's good enough it makes this
affordable to me. I know it won't be easy, especially with a 1 year old at home,
but one of the key things I learned from studying martial arts is to fear
getting too comfortable in life. Those who are comfortable and revel in it
become sluggish, lazy, accomodated and too used to a standardized routine to
adapt. I always enjoy the challenge of adapting, and being a software developer
will give me a real challenge I'm sure.
